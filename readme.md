To get started (assuming npm - works the same with yarn)
git add 
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To build the component for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:
```bash
npm test
```

(although there are no tests as yet - I'm hoping to get some up Monday morning 2nd Oct)
